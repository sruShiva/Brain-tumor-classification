# Brain-tumor-classification

This project was created as a part of a guided project in Coursera that uses efficient net model and trains it on a Brain MRI dataset. This dataset has more than 3000 Brain MRI scans which are categorized in four classes - Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor and No Tumor (used for educational purpose only). The objective of this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Brain MRI scans that belong to one of the four classes with a reasonably high accuracy.
